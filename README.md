PikiPoké is a Pokémon dating application built using React, Sass, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL, among other technologies.

Begin by selecting a Pokémon that best matches your personality, then attempt to match with other Pokémon in the Kanto Region!

Match Explanation:

Matches are based on Generation I Pokémon typing where the two Pokémon being compared must be 1/2x effective to each other.

For example, Bulbasaur is a Grass type. Therefore, Charmander (Fire-type) would prove a bad match because Fire is super effective (2x) against grass. Squirtle (Water-type) would also be a bad match because Grass is super effective (2x) against Water.

Pokémon types such as Normal, Psychic, or Fighting would also prove to be weak matches with Bulbasaur as the effectiveness rate is 1x. Good matches would include Electric and other Grass types, as they are 1/2x effective when compared to Bulbasaur.

So, Bulbasaur and Pikachu would be a great match!
